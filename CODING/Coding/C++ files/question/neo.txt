Rina is managing the inventory for a library, where each row of a 2D matrix represents the number of different genres of books available on each shelf. To get a better overview, she wants to replace each number in a row with the sum of all numbers in that row. 



Write a program to help Rina transform the matrix accordingly.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer T, representing the number of test cases.

For each test case:

The first line contains two integers R and C, representing the number of rows and columns.
The next R lines each contain C space-separated integers, representing the count of books of a specific genre on a shelf.
Output format :
For each test case, the output prints the transformed 2D matrix where each element in a row is replaced with the sum of the elements in that row.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ R, C ≤ 10

0 ≤ books count ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

3 4
8 2 4 9
4 5 6 1
7 8 9 3
2 5
1 2 3 5 7
3 4 8 9 6
Output 1 :
23 23 23 23 
16 16 16 16 
27 27 27 27 
18 18 18 18 18 
30 30 30 30 30 
Input 2 :
1
3 3 
48 65 83 
45 21 76 
71 32 98 
Output 2 :
196 196 196 
142 142 142 
201 201 201 
Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.



second question

Kate is analyzing a series of measurements and needs to determine how many of these measurements fall outside a specified acceptable range. Given a list of measurement values, write a program to count and display the number of measurements that are either below the lower limit or above the upper limit of the specified range.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer X, representing the number of measurements.

The second line consists of X space-separated integers, representing the measurement values.

The third line consists of two space-separated integers L and R, defining the acceptable range.

Output format :
The output prints an integer, representing the count of measurements that fall outside the specified range defined by L and R.

If there are no such elements, print "0".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

2 ≤ X ≤ 10

1 ≤ measurement value ≤ 100

L < R

L and R are not inclusive.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

13 24 15 26 34
11 16
Output 1 :

45 57 89 53 90 98
45 89
Output 2 :

43 56 67
43 68
Output 3 :
0
Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
